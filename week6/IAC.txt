Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning the complete IT infrastructure (comprises both physical and virtual machines) 
using machine-readable definition files. It is a software engineering approach toward operations. It helps in automating 
the complete data center by using programming scripts.

Infrastructure as code enables you to quickly set up your complete infrastructure by running a script. You can do that for every environment,
from development to production, passing through staging, QA, and more. IaC can make the entire software development lifecycle more efficient.
